Exam revision technique for advanced studies
Hi Everyone,

Back around the millenium my brother Dr. Allister Smeeton created a revision technique called exam-master that is a solid approach to revising for advanced study exams like undergraduate, post graduate and professional exams, in all subject areas.

To contribute to the open source community we would like the exam-master system to be turned into software.

I would like the main implmentation to be in C# or Java ideally, although if the majority want something different then please email me with a suggestion and justification for it.  Also if your language of choice is not either of those and you would like to create the exam-master software, then contact me and I'll see if we can arrange something.

To help with the creation of the requirements, you will need a copy of the exam-master book, I can supply you with that, please ask.

Have a great 2017!
Phil Smeeton
